**Project : Baltimore AI**

**Overview**
===============

This proposal outlines the scope and rough timeline required to further the Baltimore AI project. The scope of my work on this project includes:

* Increase the accuracy of AI model by upgrading the hardware
* Enhance the reliablity of the edge device communication
* Increse the flexibility of the software
* Enhance the user experience of the AI application

**Tasks and Estimated Times**
==========================

### Task 1: Increase AI Model Accuracy by Upgrading Hardware

* **Estimated Time**: 120 hours
* **Description**: Test, evaluate,and improve the performance of the current tracking program. Identify the optimal hardware setup to improve the accuracy of the model.
* **Deliverables**: Improved Tracking Program, optimized hardware setup

### Task 2: Enhance Edge Device Communication and Reliability

* **Estimated Time**: 150 hours
* **Description**: This task requires improving the communication between the edge device and the central server. Implement a more robust communication protocol to ensure reliable data transmission and device control, as well as investigating/implementing backup power solutions.
* **Deliverables**: Enhanced communication protocol, improved data transmission, reliable connection, real-time device communication / control.

### Task 3: Increase Software Flexibility
* **Estimated Time**: 300 hours
* **Description**: Enhance the software to allow for more flexibility in the AI model. Implement new features and functionalities to improve the user experience and make the software more adaptable to different use cases.
* **Deliverables**: Containerized software for platform agnostic deployment, improved software        flexibility, web interface for user interaction, improved user experience.
